This is a github organization for generic NPM modules under the [@npmlib](https://www.npmjs.com/org/npmlib) NPM organization.

This organization is not tied in any way to the NPM company.

The reason for this organization existing is because NPM introduced [New Package Moniker Rules](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/168978377570/new-package-moniker-rules) which prevents certain NPM package names from being published. These rules are [highly unpopular](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/19438).

Anyone can join. Please message [a maintainer](https://github.com/miguelmota) for access.
